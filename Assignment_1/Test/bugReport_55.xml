            <title>[HBASE-55] Improve Master region assignment function</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-55</link>

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;We would like the master&apos;s region assignment function to take into account more factors when choosing where to assign regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;More advanced accounting of load on regionserver - memory, # requests, etc&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don&apos;t deploy both daughter regions to the same regionserver&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Assign regions where the underlying DFS blocks are hosted if possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please add additional ideas in comments as they come up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12568377" author="bryanduxbury" created="Wed, 13 Feb 2008 00:37:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think what we actually need to do is better define what &quot;server load&quot; is. After all, we&apos;re seeking to make the set of region assignments that will cause all region servers to have the same average load. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to reformulate the name of this issue a little, we need a better way to calculate total server load. I&apos;m thinking this should be a function of the total size of all regions. The rationale behind this is that the bigger the region (ie, the underlying map files), the more time it will take to do gets, puts, compacts, etc. In the long run, machines with bigger regions will be more utilized than systems with smaller regions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to balance region assignment, we should sum up all the sizes of all the regions currently assigned per server, calculate an average, and then reduce the load of overloaded servers by deallocating regions from them, and increase the load of underloaded servers by adding newly unassigned regions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incorporate the daughter regions on different machines concept, we can just add an additional check to skip the same server as was just assigned to.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12568412" author="jimk" created="Wed, 13 Feb 2008 02:36:15 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;+1 on defining what is server load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first defined it it was very simplistic and about the best we could do at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have multiple factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;update rate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;read rate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;memory pressure on region server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;part of this will come from &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-70&quot; title=&quot;Improve region server memory management&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-70&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-70&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a more subtle problem, because you have to take into&lt;br/&gt;
account hot spots (lots of updates), cold spots (almost no updates),  memory consumption on the&lt;br/&gt;
region server, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from #regions  being served by a region server and the number of requests it had served&lt;br/&gt;
since last heartbeat, none of these other considerations were in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to do wrt region servers is come up with a metric that represents &apos;load factor&apos;&lt;br/&gt;
If people have ideas on what that computation should be we&apos;d be greatly interested in&lt;br/&gt;
hearing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our test cases are pretty artificial, and do not represent a real world load, so trying to come&lt;br/&gt;
up with a computation that tells us that a region server is too busy to accept more load is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12568419" author="bryanduxbury" created="Wed, 13 Feb 2008 03:24:34 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think the tricky part of trying to incorporate update/read rate and memory usage is that this could change very quickly, and if we are making balancing decisions based on this, we could get really bad oscillations in assignments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there&apos;s really no such thing as &quot;too busy&quot;. Either it&apos;s less busy than average, and it should take on new regions, or more busy than average, and regions should be taken away. If all of the servers have equal load, but the average is &quot;too high&quot;, then all you get is poor performance. At no point does it make sense for a region server to &quot;say no&quot; to an assignment, because in theory the master has decided that assignment is optimal for the known factors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that calculating the load factor has to be simple, otherwise we can easily get caught up trying to build a complicated load function that takes into account every factor the region server can offer, but only provides a marginal improvement over simpler functions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s try a simple metric and see what happens. If it fails to give us decent distribution, then we can go back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-70&quot; title=&quot;Improve region server memory management&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HBASE-70&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HBASE-70&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I see that not so much as a way for us to monitor how much memory is in use as for each region server to work best within the memory it has. Perhaps we also need to be aware of the &quot;swappiness&quot; of a region server (how much of it&apos;s cache is being discarded due to memory pressure), but that may be separate.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Registered listeners can run pluggable algorithms over the stream of readings to calculate &apos;load&apos;.  Other listeners can make RRD graphs to show &apos;load&apos;, update or read rates, memcache usage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12568637" author="jimk" created="Wed, 13 Feb 2008 17:17:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I disagree with the statement &quot;at no point does it make sense for a region server to &quot;say no&quot; to an assignment&quot; for one particular case: If the region server&apos;s open queue gets too deep it will not be able to open the region before the master times out the assignment and assigns the region to another server anyway. When this happens, the original server finally gets the region open, reports to master and master says &quot;close it, I&apos;ve already assigned it elsewhere&quot; in this case, two region servers can be messing with the region&apos;s files which could potentially corrupt the region.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12570023" author="bryanduxbury" created="Mon, 18 Feb 2008 22:25:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Wrong component.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12570026" author="bryanduxbury" created="Mon, 18 Feb 2008 22:29:56 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Regarding the problem with two regionservers potentially opening the same region, would it make sense to add an expiration date to the region open message? That way, there wouldn&apos;t have to be extra communication between the regionserver and master about it taking too long. If a regionserver tries to open a region and the assignment message has already expired, it can just skip it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12570058" author="jimk" created="Tue, 19 Feb 2008 00:07:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Right now the master gives the region server one hbase.hbasemaster.maxregionopen (currently the same as hbase.master.lease.period) to acknowledge that it received the open request with a HMsg.MSG_REPORT_PROCESS_OPEN If the master receives that message, it adds an additional maxregionopen time period for the region server to send a HMsg.MSG_REPORT_OPEN (the region is now on-line), before the master will reassign the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that it could take longer than that amount of time if there are a lot of log entries to apply or if the initial compaction on region open takes a while or if we get into one of those situations in which the region server cannot talk to the master (I&apos;d really like to find out why this happens).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the region server only reports in once per hbase.master.lease.period. This is probably too infrequent as we often see both MSG_REPORT_PROCESS_OPEN and MSG_REPORT_OPEN in the same set of messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably maxregionopen should be greater than lease.period or we should add a new parameter &quot;heartbeat.interval&quot; which would be less than the lease period so the region server would report in more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if the master receives a MSG_REPORT_PROCESS_OPEN, it should not take any action with respect to reassigning the region unless the region server&apos;s lease times out.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
